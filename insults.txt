Oh, It’s just you 
That’s fine if that’s what you want
You look better today
Good thing my time isn’t valuable.
Good thing I have nothing better to do than talk to you.
Oh, you’re going out like that.
I’m glad that only you can wear that.
I love how you can just wear anything.
Oh, I didn’t know that style was in.
I don’t care.
Well it’s been nice seeing you.
How’s your day been. Oh, I don’t care.
Thank God you’re here. Wasting my time.
Wow, that’s what you’re going with today?
Want to hear a joke? How do you keep an idiot in suspense?
Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the idiot on the other side. Knock Knock. It’s the chicken.
When was the last time you worked incredibly hard?
What benefit do you bring to the group when you hang out with friends?
Yeah, good luck with that.
I appreciate the lack of screwing up this time.
You look great for someone who just had a baby
Well aren’t you just the top of the bell curve
I admire your confidence
I’m glad you tried your best
You did much better than I thought you would
You totally live up to your reputation
Is that a new haircut? It looks you did that yourself
Good thing you’re pretty.
Do you enjoy talking to me? Well I’m glad you’re happy.
You worked really hard on that, didn’t you.
I love how you just don’t care what anyone thinks about you.
I was looking at your old facebook photos. Wow, you used to look so pretty.
